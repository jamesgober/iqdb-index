# iqdb-index -- Roadmap

> Path from scaffold to a stable 1.0. Hard parts are front-loaded; each phase has hard exit criteria.
>
> **Anti-deferral rule:** no listed hard task moves to a later phase unless this file records the move and the reason.

## v0.1.0 -- Scaffold (DONE)

Compiles, CI green, structure correct, no domain logic.

- [x] Manifest, README, CHANGELOG, REPS, license, CI, lints in place.
- [x] API surface sketched in `docs/API.md`.

---

## v0.2.0 -- the `Index` trait + `IndexStats` + default batch impls (THE HARD PART, NOT DEFERRED) (DONE)

Split into `IndexCore` (object-safe operational surface) + `Index` (typed
construction) so the engine can hold `Box<dyn IndexCore>`. Default
`insert_batch` / `search_batch` / `is_empty` shims. `IndexStats` with an
allocation-free `extra` default.

Exit criteria:
- [x] Every public item has rustdoc + a runnable example.
- [x] Core invariants property-tested (ordering, deletion visibility, batch == loop, cardinality).

---

## v0.3.0 -- validate against `iqdb-flat`; refine the trait

Exit criteria:
- [ ] New surface tested and benchmarked where it is a hot path.

---

## v0.4.0 -- async decision (sync default) + feature freeze

Exit criteria:
- [ ] No `todo!`/`unimplemented!`. Feature freeze declared.

---

## v0.5.0 -- doc the deletion semantics per impl + API freeze

Exit criteria:
- [ ] Public API frozen (recorded here). `cargo audit` + `cargo deny` clean.

---

## v0.6.0 -> v0.9.x -- Alpha / Beta -> RC

- 0.6.x-0.7.x: integrate against real consumers; MINOR-compatible additions only.
- 0.8.x (beta): bug fixes; broader testing; final benchmarks.
- 0.9.x (rc): critical fixes + doc polish.

---

## v1.0.0 -- Stable

- [ ] Definition of Done (DIRECTIVES section 7) satisfied.
- [ ] Public API frozen until 2.0.
- [ ] Release note written; published to crates.io; tag pushed.

---

## Out of scope for 1.0

- Any concrete index -- those are separate crates.
- Async-only trait -- sync default with optional async wrapping.
